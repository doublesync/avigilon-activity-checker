# Avigilon Activity Checker

An automation script I made for work.




## The Problem
Avigilon held door access logs for my place of work at the time (an office). We needed to figure out how many times each employee used the door on each day of the week. However, that information was quite tedious to find manually. So, I chose to spend the time automating it for the future.







## Usage

It takes a string of the table we have in Avigilon, and counts how many times the employee used the door for each day of the week. It count more than one occurrence per day, as our main usage was to see how often our employees came to the office (there are many remote employees). This helped us decide on limited parking access.
